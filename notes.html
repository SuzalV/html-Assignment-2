<h1>5 HTML tags I have learnt and their description</h1>

<dl>
<dd> <h2>Headings</h2></dd>
<dt> Headings in any page, be it print or screen, instantly make it more readable. They serve as visual cues, and the essence of
     an article is immediately obvious. Many readers simply skim the content, and pay more attention only 
     to that portion of the text that is captured by the heading that interests them. But it’s 
     not only readers who like headings, search engines too look for them. And in today’s post,
    we’ll see how WordPress Heading Tags can be used to improve both readability and SEO.</dt>

<dd> <h2>HTML image tag</h2></dd>
<dt>An HTML image tag displays an image on a webpage. It’s a self-closing tag (meaning
 it’s structured in a way so you don't have to add a separate closing tag) that contains the image source and other attributes.</dt>
 
 <dd> <h2>HTML Paragraphs</h2></dd>
 <dt>The HTML Paragraph element defines a paragraph. A paragraph always starts on a new line, 
    and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.</dt>

    <dd> <h2>Quote tag</h2></dd>
    <dt>The Quotation elements in HTML are used to insert quoted texts in a web page, 
        that is the portion of texts different from the normal texts in the web page. </dt>

        <dd> <h2>Table tag</h2></dd>
    <dt>The table HTML element represents tabular data—that is, information presented in
         a two-dimensional table comprised of rows and columns of cells containing data.</dt>

         <dd> <h2>Highlighting text</h2></dd>
         <dt>Description. The HTML mark  tag is used to mark or highlight text that is of special interest or relevance in an HTML document.
             Browsers traditionally render the text found within the mark
             tag as text with a yellow background color. This tag is also commonly referred to as the <mark> element.</dt>
